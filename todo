[ ] Create a repository for tasks with easy state management. When storing a task, only send stored task back so it can be saved by id
[ ] Create a backend for storing tasks, migration + controller + resource + request
[ ] Tie creating of task to the backend

Add link to see completed tasks
Add option to see tasks completed today and maybe options to see per day which/how many tasks were completed

Ideas:
Daily the happiness of the village goes down by a set amount or percentage. Completing tasks will increase this amount.
Every task will gain you progress points. What these progress points do have a slightly random element and will depend on what you have. There are different tiers of villages and each tier has different buildings/needs

For instance:
Tier 1, settlement: market stall, farm, houses, woodcutter - farmer, gatherer, merchant, builder, woodcutter
Tier 2, small colony: all of the above, carpenter, mining camp, barn, mill, stonecutter - carpenter, miner, stonecutter, rancher?, miller
Tier 3: all of the above, blacksmith, workshop, tailor, apothecary - blacksmith, crafter, tailor, healer

Higher tiers may upgrade buildings from before
